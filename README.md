## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 11**
- **Blade Templating**
- **Bootstrap 5** + **TailwindCSS** (light use)
- **JWT Auth**: [`tymon/jwt-auth`](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
- **Excel Export**: [`maatwebsite/excel`](https://github.com/Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel)
- **Laravel Factory & Seeder** for demo data

---

## Authentication Flow

- Auth is handled via **Blade UI forms** using `fetch` to call the `JWT` API endpoints.
- On login, token is stored in `localStorage` and a `jwt_token` cookie.
- All web routes are protected by a custom middleware `CheckJwtAuth`, which checks for a valid JWT token in `localStorage`.

---

## Example UI Features

- Flash messages (success/fail) with close button and auto timeout
- Export button styled with `rounded-pill` class
- Search + Clear filter + Add New buttons in toolbar
- Table listing with action buttons (View/Edit/Delete)
